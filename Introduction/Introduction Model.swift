    "One of the biggest threats that we are facing nowadays is the climate change. Climate change refers to the long-term changes in the climate that occur over a long period of time, for example over decades or longer.", 
    "Some of the consequences of climate change are an increase in temperature of between 2 and 4 °C, sea level rise of about 1 meter, melting of Arctic sea ice (which used to reflect the sun's heat),  …", 
    "… a decrease in the amount of forests (which absorbed carbon dioxide along with the ocean) and a long list of other consequences. All of this could happen by 2100.", 
    "Our world is getting warmer and its development is increasingly out of our hands. But, what if you had total control over the future of climate change through your decisions?"]
