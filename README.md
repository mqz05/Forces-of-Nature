# **Forces of Nature**  
**A Climate Change Awareness Card Game**  

## **Overview**  
**Forces of Nature** is a card game designed to foster decision-making skills while raising awareness about climate change. Built as part of the **WWDC22 Swift Student Challenge**, this project was selected as one of the winning submissions.  

The game combines engaging gameplay with educational content, encouraging players to make thoughtful decisions that impact four key aspects: **Ecology**, **Energy and Technological Advances**, **Economy**, and **Society**. Through interactive gameplay and dynamic card mechanics, players learn about the consequences of their choices on the planet. [See in-game images](#screenshots)

## **How It Works**  
1. **Introduction:** The game begins with an animation showcasing facts about climate change and its consequences.  
2. **Gameplay:**  
   - Players are presented with a statement, problem, or question.  
   - They slide the middle card to make decisions, considering how each choice affects the four aspects.  
3. **Outcome:** At the end of the game, players see how their decisions impacted Ecology, Energy, Economy, and Society.
